## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt CSS flex, using variables in CSS, improved my coding skills by building realistic project. Moreover, I learnt the diligence to follow the design (at least to a reasonable extent).

See sample code snippets from my solution below:

```css
:root {
  /* Primary colors */
  --pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  --bright-blue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  /* Neutral colors */
  --very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  --desaturated-blue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}
```


## Continued development

It is my desire to further learn media queries. I have deliberately avoided it in this project.
